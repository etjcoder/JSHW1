### Pyschic Game ####


This is called the Pyschic game

The objective of the game is to guess the number that the computer is guessing.

You can guess any number in the alphabet. 

Be careful, you only have 9 guesses! Don't waste them guessing the same number twice.

If at any point you're embarassed about your win/loss ratio you can wipe the slate clean by pressing the "Reset" button, but be careful as it also resets the computer's guess!
